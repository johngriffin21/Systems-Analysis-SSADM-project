# Systems-Analysis-SSADM-project
A project done for our Systems Analysis module in DCU. The grade I achieved for this was 80%. We were required to provide :A Business Activity Model (Give it at the Task level approx 15 tasks)
A Logical Data model. (Entities and relationships - be careful on: naming both sides; optionality; degree and cardinality)
A Top level context diagram for the Data Flow Diagrams
A Document Flow Diagram
A Physical Level One DFD c. 10 processes
Take two of these physical processes from your DFD and explode them into physical level 2 DFDs.
Give the Logical DFDs for the latter two physical level 2 DFDs.
Give two functions from any of the DFDs and explain their purpose using a structured English.
Give the I/O diagram for one of the Functions within this DFD.
